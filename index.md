**Welcome to my blog on Topological Data Analysis (TDA)!**

In this blog, I’ll be sharing my journey of learning TDA and exploring its applications in cancer data science, particularly in image processing. The posts will range from building a solid mathematical foundation—covering topics in algebraic topology, the backbone of TDA—to diving into practical applications in cancer image analysis.

This blog is still in its early stages, but I plan to grow it steadily over time. If you’d like to connect, share ideas, or suggest topics, please don’t hesitate to reach out!
